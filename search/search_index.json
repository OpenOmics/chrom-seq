Its long-term goals: to accurately call and annotate peaks, to infer cell types in cell-free samples, and to boldly quantify diferential binding or accessibility like no pipeline before! Overview \u00b6 Welcome to chrom-seek's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users who are getting started with our bulk epigenetic pipelines . The ./chrom-seek pipeline is composed of several interrelated sub-commands to set up and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub-commands performs different functions: chrom-seek run Run the chrom-seek pipeline with your input files. chrom-seek unlock Unlocks a previous runs output directory. chrom-seek install Download remote reference files locally. chrom-seek cache Cache remote software containers locally. chrom-seek is an awesome set of pipelines designed specifically for cell-free ChIP-seq, bulk ChIP-seq, and bulk ATAC-seq sequencing data. It relies on technologies like Singularity 1 to maintain the highest level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by Snakemake 2 , a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster. The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users. Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the usage section of each available sub-command.

Bigwigs serve as our closest approximation to truth sets. It's essential to cross-check results against them. The boundaries of peaks are primarily influenced by the tool used for analysis rather than being inherent biological features. This type of data often contains significant noise and a high background level. The majority of reads are not detected within peaks. Among the remaining reads, some may represent background artifacts, while others have biological significance. However, distinguishing between the two is challenging. Additionally, the proportion of reads within peaks is influenced by biological factors. Key points to consider \u00b6 Not all ChIP-seq data can be treated equally! Here are some main classes of proteins to consider when analyzing ChIP-seq data: Transcription factors Promoter-associated histones Enhancer-associated histones Repressive histones RNA Polymerase II Repressive histone marks Chromosome structure proteins DNA damage proteins Transcription factors are often regarded as the most straightforward targets in ChIP-seq experiments due to their high abundance, strong binding affinity, and well-characterized binding motifs. They typically exhibit clear and distinct peaks in ChIP-seq data, facilitating their detection and analysis. Moreover, transcription factors are known for their resilience to variations in processing and analysis protocols compared to other genomic features. They also demonstrate reduced dependence on ideal experimental controls. Additionally, transcription factors are frequently associated with established gold standards, which aid in sensitivity and specificity assessments in ChIP-seq assays. Their specific binding to DNA sequences further simplifies validation in laboratory experiments. Databases like ENCODE and Cistrome are valuable resources for studying specific marks. These databases employ robust data processing methods, although the sensitivity and specificity of processed features may be relatively lower compared to other methods. Some features may be poorly identified, particularly in a subset of cases. High noise and background levels affect all these methods, influenced by both biological factors and sample processing. Considering this influence is crucial at every stage of experimental design and data processing. ATAC-seq presents two primary challenges. Firstly, it explores two types of open chromatin regions, each characterized by distinct patterns and functions. These regions encompass histones flanked by spaces, typically found within active genes, and larger open regions devoid of stable histones, such as promoters. Secondly, ATAC-seq lacks a comprehensive global truth set for validation. Consequently, there is a scarcity of literature on best practices for ATAC-seq, with methodologies often relying on knowledge from similar methods. When annotating peaks, it's essential to remember: A single peak may influence multiple genes. Unless it occurs within a gene's promoter or within 1kb of a transcriptional start site, determining if the nearest gene is actually affected by the peak is challenging without additional information. Activating transcription factors within gene bodies are unlikely to affect that gene directly. Peak boundaries are arbitrary. While summits are likely binding sites for transcription factors, they may not hold true for other features. Recommendations \u00b6 General considerations \u00b6 Using QC metrics as the sole criterion for sample quality assessment is unreliable. While QC values may be informative for certain features or laboratories, they do not universally apply. While they provide a starting point, they should not be used as an automatic decision-making tool for sample exclusion! Normalized counts matrices and derived results should not be solely relied upon, as they depend on the quality of peak calls, consensus peak identification, and normalization methods used. It's crucial to confirm the validity of results using normalized bigwigs or directly generated plots. Bigwigs offer enhanced visibility as they have been processed relative to the bam files in several ways: Normalization to library size, utilizing only useful reads. Position adjustment as needed, particularly significant for single-end ChIP. Normalization against input to mitigate one form of biological noise, if available. 75 bp smoothing, aligning with the resolution of most methods (50-250bp). Peak calling \u00b6 Here's a structured approach for choosing a peak caller that is most suitable for your data. Remember to consider the specific immunoprecipation or methodology for each analysis. The following guidelines are based on the most common types of data, but they may not be applicable to all scenarios. Always consult the literature, consider the specific characteristics of your data, and visually inspect the peak calls along with their relevent tracks before making a descision. Transcription Factor (TF) Analysis Inspect the macsNarrow calls in IGV. If macsNarrow calls appear satisfactory, use macsNarrow. If not, consider using macsBroad. ATAC-seq Analysis Determine if publication status matters. If publication status matters, utilize macsNarrow. If not, compare results from macsNarrow and Genrich to determine the better option. CUN & RUN or CUT & TAG Analysis Compare results from macsNarrow and SEACR to determine the better option. Narrow Histone Mark Analysis Uncertain about whether the data represents a narrow histone mark? Consult the ENCODE documentation . Compare results from macsNarrow and macsBroad. If one outperforms the other consistently, choose the better option. If not, either option is viable. Other Marks Analysis Check the macsBroad calls. If they appear suitable, use macsBroad. If macsBroad calls don't meet expectations, assess the pipeline default sicer calls in the chrome-seek pipeline. If sicer calls are acceptable, utilize those. If not, adjust sicer conditions as necessary, noting that peak calling may not be feasible for all marks. Differential analyses \u00b6 Establishing a robust method for identifying consensus peaks is essential. To effectively utilize any differential analysis tool, it's imperative to have a shared set of peaks across all samples. This step facilitates the removal of peaks with low counts, so avoid filtering outside of this process. Keep in mind that peak calling introduces noise, and peak boundaries lack biological significance. Additionally, be aware that peaks in one sample may overlap with multiple peaks in another sample. Normalization plays a crucial role in differential peak calling. Numerous studies indicate that both the consensus peak list and normalization method significantly impact results. However, determining the optimal approach can be challenging. A consistent finding in the literature is that normalizing solely to reads within peaks, without external information, consistently yields subpar results. This is likely because a significant proportion of reads (60-99%) often reside outside peaks, representing biologically relevant but rarer binding sites. I prefer scaling to the number of reads aligning to the genome following deduplication. In DiffBind v2, the TMM output takes the raw counts, corrects for inputs when applicable, and employs a DESeq2 function to scale the samples to an external value (the number of reads in the bam file) rather than relying solely on the internal values in the counts table. In ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq analyses, simpler models tend to yield better results. This is likely due to the various sources of noise in the data, including biological, technical, and computational factors. It's essential to scrutinize results from any method used to ensure that background noise isn't being erroneously identified. In the majority of projects, skews in global fold-changes towards one condition or the other are likely to be biologically meaningful. It's essential not to artificially equalize the number of peaks on both sides of the contrast unless there's prior knowledge or a substantial difference in the size of the original libraries (exceeding 10X). It's not uncommon to observe small differential fold-changes, even among the most significant peaks. Many papers assessing differential peak calls, as well as the default conditions in tools like DiffBind, often do not include fold-change filtering. However, in my experience, it can be advantageous to incorporate a low fold-change cutoff. A reasonable starting point is an absolute fold-change cutoff of 1.5 (equivalent to a log2 value of 0.585). Alternatively, using a cutoff of 4 (log2 value of 2) will typically remove almost all peaks unless the analysis is focused on transcription factors. Please note: The pipeline opts to use a depreciated version of DiffBind for several reasons. This is by design! Here is why: DiffBind v2 has consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other differential peak callers across a wide range of features documented in the literature. DiffBind v3 lacks rigorous testing, and the author does not provide rationale for changes in default counting or normalization parameters. It is feasible to achieve results similar to DiffBind v2, especially for ATAC data or in cases lacking input samples, by configuring the pipeline correctly. However, it consistently treats input samples differently regardless of configuration. The tool automatically generates a set of consensus peaks by combining peaks identified in at least two samples, regardless of condition, allowing for partial overlap. This results in each contrast having a unique set of comparison peaks, but it enhances the accuracy of differential peak calling. However, adjustments may be necessary for large cohorts with numerous samples. In DiffBind v2, the default normalization method scales the entire library to all reads in the alignment files. This approach is generally considered one of the most effective normalization options available. Useful links \u00b6 Here are a set of useful links for learning more about ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq.

The tools used in the pipeline are listed below, along with their versions and a brief description of their purpose. Tool Version Notes MACS 1 2.2.7.1 macsNarrow : The macs2 caller optimized for narrow peaks, widely recognized as the most popular peak calling algorithm. Typically used in large databases, it identifies peaks within the range of 150bp to 10kb. Originally designed to handle peaks with a single maxima/summit, its false discovery rate (FDR) has been greatly improved with the addition of an \"input\" control. It is generally more accurate than most other peak callers, even without controls. macsBroad : The macs2 caller for slightly broader peaks, sharing a similar algorithm with macsNarrow. It is particularly useful when peaks exhibit more than one maxima/summit. Sicer 2 2-1.0.3 Sicer is a broad peak caller that can be highly effective for certain histone marks. However, it may not perform well for extra broad domains such as lamins or some repressive marks. It allows for a small amount of gaps between peaks, and users may need to adjust window and gap parameters for optimal results. Genrich 3 0.6 Designed with ATAC-seq data in mind, Genrich can yield excellent results. However, it may not be universally favored by all collaborators due to its lack of formal publication or review. MANorm 4 1.1.4 Differential peak calling when no replicates.

Many intermediate output files have a unique name or extension to denote a special meaning. In a pipeline output directory, you may see one or many files contain the same base prefix but a different set of extensions, e.g.: sorted , Q5 , or Q5DD . What do each of these file extension(s) mean? sorted : Indicates that the data has been sorted, but no further filtering has been applied. Note: blacklisted reads are filtered before alignment. Q5 : Denotes that reads with a mapping quality below 5 have been filtered out. Q5DD : Indicates both low mapping quality filtering and deduplication (removal of PCR duplicates). For paired-end data, this means that no fragments with the same exact start and end position occur more than once. For single-end data, a negative binomial distribution cutoff filter created by MACS is used. RPGC : Stands for \"reads per genomic content,\" a normalization method based on library size.

About \u00b6 The chrom-seek executable is composed of several inter-related sub commands. Please see chrom-seek -h for all available options. This part of the documentation describes options and concepts for chrom-seek cache sub command in more detail. With minimal configuration, the cache sub command enables you to cache remote resources for the chrom-seek pipeline. Caching remote resources allows the pipeline to run in an offline mode. The cache sub command can also be used to pull our pre-built reference bundles onto a new cluster or target system. The cache sub command creates local cache on the filesysytem for resources hosted on DockerHub or AWS S3. These resources are normally pulled onto the filesystem when the pipeline runs; however, due to network issues or DockerHub pull rate limits, it may make sense to pull the resources once so a shared cache can be created and re-used. It is worth noting that a singularity cache cannot normally be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces that its cache is owned by the user.

The cache sub command can also be used to pull our pre-built reference bundles onto a new cluster or target system. The cache sub command creates local cache on the filesysytem for resources hosted on DockerHub or AWS S3. These resources are normally pulled onto the filesystem when the pipeline runs; however, due to network issues or DockerHub pull rate limits, it may make sense to pull the resources once so a shared cache can be created and re-used. It is worth noting that a singularity cache cannot normally be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces that its cache is owned by the user.

Optional arguments are shown in square brackets. A user must provide a list of FastQ (globbing is supported) to analyze via --input argument and an output directory to store results via --output argument, define an assay type to select an appropriate data-processing pipeline via --assay argument, select a reference genome to be used for alignment and annotation via --genome argument, and a peakcall file to define groups/inputs/blocking factors for each sample. Use you can always use the -h option for information on a specific command. 2.1 Required arguments \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are required. Failure to provide a required argument will result in a non-zero exit-code. --assay {cfChIP,ChIP,ATAC} Assay type or data-processing pipeline. type: string This option defines which pipeline will be run. chrom-seek supports the processing of bulk ChIP-seq (ChIP), cell-free DNA ChIP-seq (cfChIP), and ATAC-seq (ATAC) samples. Please select from one of the following data-processing pipelines: cfChIP , ChIP , ATAC . Example: --assay ChIP --genome {hg19,hg38,mm10} Reference genome. type: string This option defines the reference genome of the samples for alignment and annotation. There are prebuilt reference files for human, mouse, and rhesus data. Please select one of the following options: hg19 , hg38 , mm10 , rheMac10 . Example: --genome hg19 --input INPUT [INPUT ...] Input FastQ or BAM file(s). type: file(s) One or more FastQ files can be provided. From the command-line, each input file should seperated by a space. Globbing is supported! This makes selecting FastQ files easy. FastQ files should always be gzipp-ed. Only list files you want processed as all files in the list will be run through the initial pipeline steps. All file merging must be done before running the pipeline. Example: --input .tests/*.R?.fastq.gz --output OUTPUT Path to an output directory. type: path This location is where the pipeline will create all of its output files, also known as the pipeline's working directory. If the provided output directory does not exist, it will be created automatically. Example: --output /data/$USER/chrom-seek_out --peakcall PEAKCALL Peakcall file. type: file This tab delimited (TSV) file is used to pair each ChIP sample to its corresponding input sample and to assign any groups that are associated with said sample. Please note that multiple groups can be assigned to a given sample using a comma. Group information is used to setup comparsions within groups of samples. This file consists of three columns containing the name of each ChIP sample, the name of each Input (control) sample, and the name of its groups. Each sample must be assigned to at least one group. The header of this file needs to be ChIP for the chips column, Input for the inputs column, and Group for the groups column. Group names currently cannot include \".\", \"-\", or \"_\". The base name of each sample should be listed in the ChIP and Input columns. The base name of a given sample can be determined by removing its file extension from the sample's R1 FastQ file, example: WT_S4.R1.fastq.gz becomes WT_S4 in the peakcall file. WT_S4_R1_001.fastq.gz also becomes WT_S4 . An optional column, called Block, can also be provided to block duplicate correlations between repeated observations. Typically, blocks are biological replicates or multiple samples from same indivdual. Contents of example peakcalls file: ChIP Input Group WT_S1 IN_S1 G1,G3 WT_S2 IN_S2 G1,G3 WT_S3 IN_S3 G1 WT_S4 IN_S4 G2,G4 WT_S5 IN_S5 G2,G4 WT_S6 IN_S6 G2 Example: --peakcall /data/$USER/peakcall.tsv 2.2 Analysis options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. 2.2.1 Differential Binding/Accessibility \u00b6 --contrasts CONTRASTS Contrasts file. type: file This tab delimited (TSV) file is used to setup comparisons within different groups of samples. Please see the --peakcall option above for more information about how to define groups within a set of samples. This file consists of two columns containing the names of two groups to compare. The names defined in this file must also exist in the peakcall file. Please note: the ordering of groups is preserved when creating contrasts. This is important because it dicates how to interpret the direction of the fold-change for your comparison. In the example below, the first comparison can be interpreted as G2 vs. G1 . This would result in the following contrast: G2-G1 . Within the context of differential binding analysis, a positive fold-change would indicate that the G2 group has higher levels of binding (cfChIP/ChIP) or accessibility (ATAC) at X region. Contents of example contrasts file: G2 G1 G4 G1 G4 G3 Example: --contrasts /data/$USER/contrasts.tsv 2.3 Orchestration options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. --dry-run Dry run the pipeline. type: boolean flag Displays what steps in the pipeline remain or will be run. Does not execute anything! Example: --dry-run --silent Silence standard output. type: boolean flag Reduces the amount of information directed to standard output when submitting master job to the job scheduler. Only the job id of the master job is returned. Example: --silent --mode {slurm,local} Execution Method. type: string default: slurm Execution Method. Defines the mode or method of execution. Vaild mode options include: slurm or local. slurm The slurm execution method will submit jobs to the SLURM workload manager . It is recommended running chrom-seek in this mode as execution will be significantly faster in a distributed environment. This is the default mode of execution. local Local executions will run serially on compute instance. This is useful for testing, debugging, or when a users does not have access to a high performance computing environment. If this option is not provided, it will default to a local execution mode. Example: --mode slurm --job-name JOB_NAME Set the name of the pipeline's master job. type: string default: pl:chrom-seek When submitting the pipeline to a job scheduler, like SLURM, this option always you to set the name of the pipeline's master job. By default, the name of the pipeline's master job is set to \"pl:chrom-seek\". Example: --job-name pl_id-42 --singularity-cache SINGULARITY_CACHE Overrides the $SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR environment variable. type: path default: --output OUTPUT/.singularity Singularity will cache image layers pulled from remote registries. This ultimately speeds up the process of pull an image from DockerHub if an image layer already exists in the singularity cache directory. By default, the cache is set to the value provided to the --output argument. Please note that this cache cannot be shared across users. Singularity strictly enforces you own the cache directory and will return a non-zero exit code if you do not own the cache directory! See the --sif-cache option to create a shareable resource. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/.singularity --sif-cache SIF_CACHE Path where a local cache of SIFs are stored. type: path Uses a local cache of SIFs on the filesystem. This SIF cache can be shared across users if permissions are set correctly. If a SIF does not exist in the SIF cache, the image will be pulled from Dockerhub and a warning message will be displayed. The chrom-seek cache subcommand can be used to create a local SIF cache. Please see chrom-seek cache for more information. This command is extremely useful for avoiding DockerHub pull rate limits. It also remove any potential errors that could occur due to network issues or DockerHub being temporarily unavailable. We recommend running chrom-seek with this option when ever possible. Example: --singularity-cache /data/$USER/SIFs --threads THREADS Max number of threads for each process. type: int default: 2 Max number of threads for each process. This option is more applicable when running the pipeline with --mode local . It is recommended setting this vaule to the maximum number of CPUs available on the host machine. Example: --threads 12 --tmp-dir TMP_DIR Max number of threads for each process. type: path default: /lscratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID Path on the file system for writing temporary output files. By default, the temporary directory is set to '/lscratch/$SLURM_JOB_ID' for backwards compatibility with the NIH's Biowulf cluster; however, if you are running the pipeline on another cluster, this option will need to be specified. Ideally, this path should point to a dedicated location on the filesystem for writing tmp files. On many systems, this location is set to somewhere in /scratch. If you need to inject a variable into this string that should NOT be expanded, please quote this options value in single quotes. Example: --tmp-dir /scratch/$USER/ 2.4 Miscellaneous options \u00b6 Each of the following arguments are optional, and do not need to be provided. -h, --help Display Help. type: boolean flag Shows command's synopsis, help message, and an example command Example: --help 3.
